Meat

On a farm in Derbyshire, with many hundreds of his kin and a host of other Eatens, Rich of the family Beef was born and fattened. His family were among the most numerous of the Eatens, admired around the world for their dark, juicy meat and versatility; they could be roasted, grilled or fried and went perfectly with chips. Rich was the largest Beef of his generation, he was 3.6 metres tall with enormous muscles and a healthy layer of fat. His chest was broad and long, and he had more ribs than any of his relatives; most had 36 but he possessed a full 40! His stature was the most magnificent since the time of Smokey the Great-Rump, who, according to legend, was able to provide burgers for forty Eaters at a feast of the Golden Arches.

Rich was 21, and at this age he had reached his prime. He was ready for the Slaughter, an honour he had been awaiting with hungry anticipation. The day of Slaughter was the pinnacle of an Eaten’s life, the fruition of a lifetime’s training and development. All the hours he had spent in the meal sheds, pushing his stomach to its limits, every exercise session, lifting weights until his muscles felt as though they might burst, it would all be worth it at the final Weighing. The Weighing was a judgement of worth, and everybody found validation in their final mass.

*

That morning Rich woke at sunrise, washed and put on the same ceremonial dress that his father and six elder brothers had worn before him. It was a light, simple tunic, bearing the deep red colour of the Beef family; it was very large, but still it felt tight on him. This was cause enough for Rich to swell up with pride. He knew he would be over 300 kilograms, but he was confident that he would surpass all of his brothers. His progress from the barn to the shambles was slow, interrupted by hugging and congratulations from every member of his family, the children he had fathered, and all the friends he had made during his life. When he finally reached the grand marble archway that marked the entrance to the shambles, it was already midday. He pushed open the heavy oak door and stepped inside.

‘Rich, of the family Beef!’
His announcement came from somewhere to his right, but Rich knew his destiny lay straight in front of him. The Hall of Weighing was a circular atrium, about 20 metres in diameter, with an altar on the Northern wall and a large door to the West, opposite the one he had just entered. The room was dominated, however, by the smallest item in it. At the centre of the circle stood a set of scales, just large enough that two average-sized Beefs could stand side by side on them. Rich started to tremble with excitement, but he held a noble stance as he waited for his cue. The farmer at the altar spoke again.
‘Come forward, Rich, on this day of your Weighing, and step onto the scales that your worth may be measured.’
Rich walked slowly across the atrium, taking each step deliberately, not wishing to taint this moment with a careless slip. He stepped up onto the scales and faced the farmer.
‘This is a most joyous day, mighty Rich; we have been awaiting your Slaughter most anxiously. I, personally, have been watching you carefully since your birth. It has always been my belief that you are one of the Chosen Cuts.’
Rich could feel tears welling up in his eyes; he smiled at the farmer but kept his posture.
‘And so we proceed to that fateful moment.’
The farmer looked down at the screen on the altar and touched it once. He smiled and looked up at Rich.
‘Do you remember how much your father weighed, my son?’
‘306 kilograms farmer. He was the heaviest of his brothers.’
‘Yes, that’s right, and I think you know that you are the heaviest of yours. Your mass, my son, is 348 kilograms. You are the heaviest Eaten this farm has ever seen!’
Rich was stunned. He stood still, unable to move, for several seconds before falling to the floor in tears. He felt pure bliss, he had led the most virtuous of lives, and this was his reward. After a few minutes, however, he straightened up and wiped his face. He had one more task to complete.
‘Know that we are all proud of you, Rich of the Beef, and that you will be remembered for a very long time. Now go, and receive the Slaughter you so deserve.’
Rich bowed his head low and turned to face the Western door. As he opened it, he smiled to himself. How peaceful he felt, how serene. He walked through the door towards his destiny.

Upon entering the Slaughter Chamber, Rich immediately sensed that something was wrong. The room was set up exactly as he had had it described to him by the farmers, but something didn’t quite fit. The machine at the centre of the Chamber was silent, completely inactive, and the farmer at the control panel seemed awkward and uncomfortable. He waited for his cue.
‘Hey, you, get over here!’ The farmer squeaked at him while beckoning to him wildly with his hands. ‘We haven’t got much time!’
Rich walked slowly towards the centre of the room, watching the farmer cautiously. All of his former peace and serenity had disappeared.
‘Quick, come with me!’
The farmer took Rich by the wrist and pulled him towards a door on the far side of the room. Rich followed the man without question – he was a farmer, after all – but his mind was racing, trying to work out what was going on. He was led through the door, and then two more, finally arriving outside. Almost blinded by the sunlight, Rich was pushed into the back of a lorry before he knew what was happening and the doors were shut behind him. Blind once more, he grappled around in the darkness and found other people mimicking his confusion. The lorry lurched forward, knocking him off his feet and onto a sprawling mass of body parts that didn’t belong to him. From outside a siren sounded, and in an instant he understood; the farm had fallen victim to poachers.

*

The lorry came to a halt after several hours, although Rich couldn’t be sure how many. He had managed to get comfortable in a corner; the other captives gave him a wide berth when they realised how big he was. They had talked a little, but no one else understood the situation any better than he did. The doors opened and lights shone in at them, but night had clearly fallen. Men with shock batons herded them out of the lorry and down a narrow but well-worn pathway through the woods. The men were small, clearly Eaters, but their characteristics were unfamiliar to Rich. Poachers were usually athletic, with long limbs and sharp eyes; these men were short and plump, and some of them were wearing glasses! They reminded him of the doctors he had met at the farm, but the way they carried themselves betrayed much less confidence. They all seemed very uncomfortable around their new captives; they kept their distance and held the prods firmly levelled at their targets. Eventually they reached three large tents surrounding a campfire. Rich could make out men with rifles in the trees all around, watching them warily. They were led into a tent and sat down in chairs facing a table and a seated man. One of the strange Eaters was sitting in front of them; this one was different, more confident, somehow, but with the same peculiar proportions. He was also bespectacled, and his head was almost entirely hairless, except for a narrow band around the circumference. When the Eatens had taken their places he stood up and began to speak.

‘Welcome, fellow children of Luca!’ He exclaimed with fervour. ‘You must be confused, and disorientated. It was not our intention for you to go through such an ordeal, but-‘ he flashed a smarmy grin around the room ‘- I’m afraid it was the only way we could save you.’ He continued looking around, and his smile faded slightly; he must have noticed the blank expressions on his audience’s faces. ‘You require some explanation of course. You see, throughout your lifetimes you have been brainwashed, indoctrinated with the belief that it is your purpose on this Earth to grow, reproduce and to be eaten by other people. But this is simply not the case! You are human beings, and like other human beings, you should be free to live long lives without being Slaughtered in your prime!’
At this several of the children began to cry, and Rich could barely contain his rage. This man was clearly insane, and he didn’t want to hear anything else he had to say. He started to get up and - Bzzzzt! - He was hit by a baton from somewhere behind him. The shock sent his muscles into spasms, leaving him squirming on the chair. The other Eatens glared around angrily, but took the message and stayed seated.
‘Now, I understand how hard this must be for you to hear, and that’s why we are taking such precautions.’ The speaker continued, glancing at his companions around the edges of the tent. ‘But you must believe that we are on your side. We wouldn’t want you to do anything rash that might spoil the chance we are offering you.’ He clasped his hands together and smiled again, more cautiously this time. ‘My name is Lector of the family Biologist. The people of this camp are all my kin; we have left our prescribed paths and come here to pursue a new goal. Twelve years ago, my research team and I began investigating the links between the three Life Sciences, Doctory, Botany and Microby. It has long been known that all living things share some common features, both chemical and genetic, but no one had really considered what it might mean. We were analysing the genomes of different breeds of humans and plants when it hit us; they had a shared ancestry. We select for certain traits in our peoples, and for many years we have been getting closer and closer to perfect specialisation, but, in spite of this, we all share many genes. Extrapolating backwards, some have speculated that at one time, all humans were alike. What we considered was that, perhaps, all living things could have their ancestry traced back in a similar way...’ The speaker trailed off, he could tell he had lost some of his audience, but Rich was listening intently.
‘The analysis was complex, and I won’t bore you with the details...’ Lector continued carefully. ‘But what we found was that all do share a genetic history, even the bacteria. We are all descendents of a common ancestor, a being we have named the last universal common ancestor, Luca!’ This time he couldn’t restrain himself. He grinned maniacally at his audience and barely kept from bouncing on the spot. Rich had heard enough.
‘It’s a fantasy,’ he said softly, but in a gruff tone, ‘people have had this idea before, but there’s no way we can be related. There would be intermediates, like the Chicken-Porks, they’re the only evidence for a common Eaten ancestry.’
‘That’s true, young Beef, but there are other intermediates that you won’t have been told about. Has anyone here heard of the Uneatables?’ The tent was silent. ‘There is a legend that goes back many thousands of years, to the time when humans started farming. At that time, the guiding tenets of Eugenics were understood, but the discipline required to carry them out was, let’s say... underdeveloped. Farmers and the Eatens they were responsible for would occasionally become romantically entangled. Children were born with imperfect characteristics, some on the Eater side, and some on the Eaten. Those that were used for their meat were unsavoury to the palate, and the practise was soon clamped down on. However, the ones that survived have left an interesting genetic imprint on the farmers, one that has validated our research quite well.’
‘So what?’ Rich shouted impatiently. ‘So we weren’t always this different, but we are now. We all have our place in the world, our purpose. Why would you want to change that?’
‘Because,’ Lector responded calmly, ‘those aren’t the intermediates we’re interested in.’

*

When Rich was 6 years old, his father had taken him out to the croplands. He had shown him the rolling fields of maize, the line upon line of potato plants and the apple and pear orchards. He described each crop they came across in great detail; Rich was curious and asked questions about everything. Finally, they sat down in a spot overlooking the great pools of algae that were grown for their own consumption.
‘What have you learnt today, Rich?’ His father would ask him this often, whether he had been teaching him or not.
‘Today I learnt about maize, which can be milled into flour, which can be used to make bread. I learned about many root vegetables and fruits, which are a great source of energy for Eaters.’
‘These are the things I have told you, Rich, but there is something else you should have realised.’
Rich thought for a moment. ‘Each of these crops, they are unique, they each fulfil a special purpose.’
‘Very good, my son. I knew you would see this. It is true of all living things, we each have a role to play in the world, and we are blessed with characteristics that make this possible. But we are different to the plants, Rich. We do not sit in the soil and wait for nature to give us our destiny. We must always be working to fulfil our own purpose.’
His father got up and started walking back towards the farm. Rich followed, his mind filled with thoughts, alive with inspiration.

*
‘Many years ago, before farms, before we built the floating cities to free up space for cropland, people varied randomly. We had not fully realised the potential of Eugenics, and we had no incentive to, we could sustain the chaos because we were not too many. Our populations kept increasing, however, and it was clear that something had to be done. There are few records from this time, but there is one piece of literature that is often debated and swiftly derided by the Historian clan. ‘The Hungry Phoenix’ is a novel that was written in 2186 by Gordon Fluke. It tells the story of a people on the brink of collapse. A nation state, bordered by sea, with a population it could not feed. There is one extract in particular that I find most interesting.’ Lector pulled a leaf of paper from his pocket and unfolded it.

‘Chapter 4 – The Protein Problem

We had long given up hope that the crops would be enough; we simply didn’t have enough land to grow food for everybody. Besides, we needed a better source of protein, tofu and similar substitutes were inefficient and it would take years to develop algae that suited our requirements. Everybody was thinking about the same thing, but nobody was prepared to talk about it. Thousands died of starvation before the government finally took a stance. I still remember the billboards: “Ask not how your country can feed you– Ask how you can feed your country”. It wasn’t easy at first – convincing people to give up their lives is never easy – but it got easier when we took away the choice, and introduced the lottery. People were more than willing to sacrifice each other when the system was completely random; it just seemed fair. Of course, later on we would remove the random element, after we had worked out who was best to eat... If only we hadn’t been so careless with the animals, we might have avoided this entirely...’

As the Biologist finished speaking, several of the Eatens started to murmur. This story about a world of uncertain destinies clearly troubled them. Rich had spotted what Lector had found so interesting though. He was interested too.
‘What were the animals?’
Lector smiled at him, he knew he was on the hook. ‘The animals were creatures that were not men. They had bodies, like us, hearts and nervous systems, skeletons in many cases, but they were distinctly different from humans.’
‘But, how do you know they weren’t just other people?’
‘They were related to us, of course, but they had completely different physiologies, even taking into account the diversity we have today. Some of them didn’t even have brains!’
This was almost too much for Rich to bear; this lunatic was speaking of myth and legend as if it were fact.
‘There were animals that could fly without the aid of a Flysuit, swimming animals with fins attached to their bodies, there were even creatures bigger than you, Beef, roaming the open plains of the ancient Earth.’
For the third time, Rich lost his patience. He leapt up and forwards, dodging the jab that came from behind him. Knocking another Biologist to the floor with one punch, he grabbed the baton they’d been holding and shocked the man who had attacked him earlier. He turned and ran towards Lector, gripped his neck in the crook of his arm and held the baton to his temple.
‘Tell your men to let us go!’ He barked at the little man, who seemed even littler up close.
‘You’re making a mistake!’ Lector squeaked, now exhibiting none of the confidence he had shown previously. ‘We have proof!’
Rich hesitated, but kept his grip firm. ‘If this is a trick- ‘
‘It isn’t! You can keep me hostage, but let me send for the evidence, it will convince you! It has to!’
His curiosity piqued, Rich knew he had to see what Lector hadn’t shown until now. This was clearly his trump card. If it didn’t impress him... Well, he could think about that in the meantime. ‘Ok, show me this evidence, but if your men try anything else, I’ll snap your neck.’
‘Of course! Of course!’ He turned to a man on his right, who Rich hadn’t noticed up until now; he had been sitting at the edge of the tent, out of view. He didn’t seem to have any weapons. ‘Zoolo! Bring out the Kraken!’

The man hurried out of the tent and returned several minutes later with a box, about a metre long and half a metre in breadth and depth, veiled with a piece of tarpaulin. He placed it on the table at the front, next to Rich and his hostage, being careful not to make any sudden movements.
‘Open it up!’ Rich was giving the order now, and Zoolo was quick to obey. He carefully removed the tarpaulin, exposing a glass cuboid filled with water.
‘What is it?’
‘Look closely, down at the bottom; She likes to hide in the sand.’
Feeling stupid, Rich took the advice, but squeezed Lector’s neck even tighter as he did so. At the bottom of the box the sand was moving. He bent down closer. There was something making it move, something alive... Suddenly the something was wriggling out onto the surface; it was only about a centimetre long, and far less in width, but it was moving! Rich knew plants moved a little, but never this fast; besides, this something wasn’t green...
‘Well, what do you think? We found it deep in the Marianas Trench; we named it the Kraken after an ancient monster of legend.’ Rich looked at him sceptically. ‘We’re not convinced monsters ever existed, at least not yet.’
‘What is it, though?’
‘Its genome is unlike anything else we’ve studied, but it shares far more genes with us than with anything else. It is the missing link between us and other life. It’s an animal!’
Rich loosened his grip and stood up; he would need to think about this. A new life form was certainly grounds for reconsidering his position. Letting the Biologist go, he walked back to his seat and sat down, resting his head in his hands.
Lector seized his victory. ‘Eatens of the Derbyshire Farm! This creature proves that humans are not alone! Animals really did exist, and at least one still does! With the proper study and genetic manipulation we can make them walk the Earth once more!’
A woman called out from near the back of the tent. ‘Why should we care? Even if you can engineer such creatures, why would it matter to us?’
‘Because, my dear Venison, these animals were made of meat!’

The tent was silent for several minutes as the Eatens considered what Lector was implying. They were not the only meat. Other things could be consumed that provided the same benefits to the Eaters. The Eatens themselves might even start to eat these “animals”. The world didn’t have to be divided in the way it was! The farmers had always taught them to respect reason and logic above all. That was why their fate as food was so easy to understand. Now they realised there had been a flaw in the reasoning, a lack of knowledge. They were prepared to come to a different conclusion...

Bang! Bang bang bang!
Gunshots rang out from the direction of the pathway they had taken into the camp. An explosion made the whole tent shake violently.
‘Quick! Get out there, hold them off!’ Lector seemed panicked. ‘Eatens! Come with me, we can protect you, but we need to leave now!’
The Biologists pulled out guns they had been concealing in their boots and ran outside. Several Eatens got up and walked towards the entrance. Zoolo lifted up the water-filled box and joined them. Only Rich and the woman who had spoken up before remained in their seats.
‘What are you waiting for?’ Lector screamed. ‘We have to go!’
‘There’s one thing I don’t understand.’ Rich spoke slowly, deliberately. ‘Why do you need us?’
‘We’re trying to save you!’
‘No... That’s not it. Why go to all this trouble only to take a dozen of us? Don’t think I haven’t noticed that you’ve gathered one of us from each of the families. Why did you bring us here?’ The shots were getting louder now, and another explosion ripped through a corner of the tent, killing the Venison and scattering half of the empty chairs. ‘Tell me! Why do you need us!’
‘Because without you we can’t create meat! We need your genetic data to help us make Beef animals, and Pork animals, animals that people will eat!’
Rich stood up and walked towards Lector, nodding in understanding. He looked into the little man’s eyes and smiled. ‘So what are we waiting for?’ He asked. They rushed to the door and joined the group, now huddling behind three guards who were shooting out into the darkness.
‘Quickly! Get to the trucks! Wait- What are you doing?!’ To the horror of everyone watching, Rich had stuck his arm into the box of water. He pulled out its precious contents, holding it delicately between his massive fingers, and stuck it into his mouth.
‘Gulp.’
‘What have you done? That was our proof of concept!’ Lector cowered as the larger man squared up to him.
‘You’ve given me all the proof I need.’ Rich punched the tiny man in the jaw and before he had hit the ground was rounding on the men with guns. With a mighty tackle he knocked them all down, and he brought a hefty elbow down on one who was reaching to regain his gun. ‘Hold your fire! It’s us!’ He shouted to the shadows, and the gunshots were soon replaced with lights shining in their faces.

*

‘Rich, of the family Beef! Come forward my son.’
Rich walked proudly across the atrium and stood on the scales at its centre.
‘You have performed above and beyond your duty, Rich. You have done more for humanity than anyone in the history of this farm.’
Rich smiled softly.
‘Your mass has not changed much, my son, but I can tell you what it is, if you wish.’
‘Please.’
‘You are now 350 kilograms, even heavier than when you left us. This is a great achievement, in the face of such adversity. How did you ever do it?’
Rich thought for a moment, and answered triumphantly.
‘Eating well.’
